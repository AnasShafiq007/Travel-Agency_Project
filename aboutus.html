<blockquote><b>Difference between the two journeys</b></blockquote>

<p><blockquote>
Umrah comes second in importance to Hajj. However, if performed in the holy month of Ramadan, it is considered equal to Hajj. Also there is difference in rites and rituals of the two.
 In Umrah pilgrims enter in state of Ihram, they offer Tawaf of the Holy Ka’ba, walk between Safa and Marwa (Sayi), get their head shaved and come out of the state of Ihram.
 In Hajj, pilgrim after Sayi travels to Minna and stays at least one night there, then goes to Maidan-e-Arafat to listen to the sermon.
 Afterwards, they pay visit to Muzdalifa and collect pebbles to throw on Jamrat pillar in Minna, then get their head shaved and offer slaughter at the same time.
 <br><br>
 Umrah can be performed at any time throughout the year. Muslims prefer to perform it during summer and December.
